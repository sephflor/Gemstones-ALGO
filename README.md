# Gemstones-ALGO.This implementation finds the number of gemstones (minerals that appear in every rock) by starting with the minerals from the first rock and successively intersecting with minerals from each subsequent rock, efficiently solving the problem using HashSet operations with O(n*m) time complexity where n is number of rocks and m is average rock length.
